A couple homework assignments from CS 470

hw2_4b is my solution to the skyline problem
-given a list of "buildings" in (start position, height, end position), returns a list of all Y changes in form (position, height)

hw3_1b is my solution to solving the fibonacci sequence using dynamic programing
-given n, returns the number at that position in the fibonacci sequence 

hw3_2a is my solutions to solving the longest palindrome in a word using dynamic programing
-given a word or list of words, returns longest palindrome in word
-the commented out sections are my first attempt at solving this problem. It is slow in comparison to the dynamic version however still clever in my opinion
